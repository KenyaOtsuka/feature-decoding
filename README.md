# Feature decoding

This repository provides scripts of deep neural network (DNN) feature decoding from fMRI brain activities, originally proposed by [Horikawa & Kamitani (2017)](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15037) and employed in DNN-based image reconstruction methods of [Shen et al. (2019)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006633) as well as recent studies in Kamitani lab.

## Usage

### Environment setup

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and then run:

```shell
# Create .venv and install all dependencies (reads pyproject.toml / uv.lock)
$ uv sync

# Activate (optional; scripts can also be run via `uv run python ...`)
$ . .venv/bin/activate
```

### Data setup

Run the following commands in `data` directory to download required fMRI and DNN features.

```shell
# In "./data" directory:

# fMRI data (collected by Shen et al., 2019)
python download.py fmri_deeprecon_fmriprep_vc

# DNN features (VGG-19)
python download.py features_imagenet_training_vgg19
python download.py features_imagenet_test_vgg19
```

### Decoding with PyFastL2LiR

- Training: `train_decoder_fastl2lir.py`
- Test (prediction): `predict_feature_fastl2lir.py`
- Evaluation: `evaluation.py`
- Example config file: [deeprecon_pyfastl2lir_alpha100_vgg19_allunits.yaml](config/deeprecon_pyfastl2lir_alpha100_vgg19_allunits.yaml)

```shell
# Training of decoding models
$ python train_decoder_fastl2lir.py config/deeprecon_pyfastl2lir_alpha100_vgg19_allunits.yaml

# Prediction of DNN features
$ python predict_feature_fastl2lir.py config/deeprecon_pyfastl2lir_alpha100_vgg19_allunits.yaml

# Evaluation
$ python evaluation.py config/deeprecon_pyfastl2lir_alpha100_vgg19_allunits.yaml
```

### Decoding with scikit-learn Ridge regression

- Training: `train_decoder_sklearn_ridge.py`
- Test (prediction): `predict_feature.py`
- Evaluation: `evaluation.py`
- Example config file: [deeprecon_sklearn_ridge_alpha100_vgg19_allunits](config/deeprecon_sklearn_ridge_alpha100_vgg19_allunits.yaml)

```shell
# Training of decoding models
$ python train_decoder_sklearn_ridge.py config/deeprecon_sklearn_ridge_alpha100_vgg19_allunits.yaml

# Prediction of DNN features
$ python predict_feature.py config/deeprecon_sklearn_ridge_alpha100_vgg19_allunits.yaml

# Evaluation
$ python evaluation.py config/deeprecon_sklearn_ridge_alpha100_vgg19_allunits.yaml
```

The scikit-learn Ridge decoder is trained and stored in a factorized form: the
model maps brain activity onto the training stimulus basis, and prediction
combines its coefficients with the training features. This is mathematically
identical to regressing the features directly, but the stored decoder is much
smaller and training does not scale with the feature dimension.
`predict_feature.py` therefore reads the training features
(`decoder.features.paths`, already set in the example config). See
`ridge_factorization.py` for the details.

### Cross-validation feature decoding

- Training: `cv_train_decoder_fastl2lir.py`
- Test (prediction): `cv_predict_feature_fastl2lir.py`
- Evaluation: `cv_evaluation.py`
- Example config file: [deeprecon_cv_pyfastl2lir_alpha100_vgg19_allunits](config/deeprecon_cv_pyfastl2lir_alpha100_vgg19_allunits.yaml)

```shell
# Training of decoding models
$ python cv_train_decoder_fastl2lir.py config/deeprecon_cv_pyfastl2lir_alpha100_vgg19_allunits.yaml

# Prediction of DNN features
$ python cv_predict_feature_fastl2lir.py config/deeprecon_cv_pyfastl2lir_alpha100_vgg19_allunits.yaml

# Evaluation
$ python cv_evaluation.py config/deeprecon_cv_pyfastl2lir_alpha100_vgg19_allunits.yaml
```

### Tests

The test suite runs on small synthetic data generated on the fly; no downloaded
dataset is required.

```shell
# Install the test dependencies and run the suite
$ uv sync --group dev
$ uv run pytest
```

`tests/data/golden/` holds regression fixtures recording the numerical output of
the decoding pipeline. Regenerate them with
`uv run python -m tests.generate_golden` only when the expected output is meant
to change, and say so explicitly in the commit message.
